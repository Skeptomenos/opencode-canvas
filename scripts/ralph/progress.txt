## Codebase Patterns
- Editor files go in `src/canvases/editor/` directory
- Use `const` exclusively, avoid `let`
- No semicolons (Prettier config)
- 120 character line width
- Use `??` for nullish coalescing defaults

## Sat Jan 10 2026 - US-001
- What was implemented: EditorState interface and createEditorState() function
- Files changed: src/canvases/editor/editor-state.ts (new file)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - EditorState includes: mode, lines, cursorLine, cursorCol, isDirty, filePath, isReadOnly
  - EditorMode is "normal" | "insert"
  - Helper functions: getEditorContent(), getCurrentLine(), clampCursorCol()
  - Empty files should have one empty line (lines.length >= 1)
  - Cursor bounds differ by mode: insert allows cursor at line.length, normal stops at line.length - 1

## Sat Jan 10 2026 - US-002
- What was implemented: Normal mode navigation functions (h/j/k/l, 0, $, gg, G)
- Files changed: src/canvases/editor/editor-navigation.ts (new file)
- **Learnings for future iterations:**
  - Navigation functions are pure: (EditorState) => EditorState
  - moveDown/moveUp clamp cursor column to new line length
  - Use Math.max(0, line.length - 1) for normal mode cursor bounds
  - moveToFirstLine and moveToLastLine reset cursor column to 0
